Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems efficientlly and reliably. Importance of sotware engineering in the industry include but not limited to ensuring that software are reliable, secure and scalable. They also improve efficiency when managing large software projects and resolves the issue of complexity. 

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

In the early 1950s, early programming was done in machine code and assembly languages. Later in the 1970s, the waterfall model introduced systematic software development phases. In the 2001s, agile methodologies were introduced with emphasy on flexibility and customer collaboration.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

First, conduct a requirement analysis to understand what the software should do. Secondly, in the design phase, plan tthe architecture and user interface. it is followed by the implementation phase where the actual code is written. Then test the software functions orrectly. then release the software for users. The final phase is ensure maintenance to fix bugs and update the software.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

When comparing the approach. waterfall methodologies are linear, step by step while agile are flexible. Waterfall methodologies are hard to make changes or adjustments mid project while agile is easily adaptaable to changes.
Waterfall technloges are most suitable for large well defined project while the agile technologies are best for fast changing pprojects such as mobile applications.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A s0ftware developer writes, tests and maintains code.
A quality assurance engineer essures software works correctly through testing.
A project manager oversees the project team coordination. timelnes an budgets.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are key in providing tools for coding, testing and debugging such as VS code.
VCS track changes made in the code and enable collaboration eg Github.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging complex issues is a key challenge. The solustion is using sytematic debugging technique and tools.
Keeping up with new technologies. The solution is adapting continous learning and practice.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is useful in testing individual components.
Integration testing ensures modules work together correctly.
System testing validates the whole system.
Acceptance testing corfirms that the software meets user requirment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It is the practice of designing effective prompts to improve interactions with AI models. It helps generate more accurate and relevant responses.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt eg "Tell me about diabetes"
Improved prompt eg "What are the types of diabetes, causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment."
Improved prompt is better because it is clear, specific and results to more targeted responses.
